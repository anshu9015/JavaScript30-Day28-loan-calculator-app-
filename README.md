ðŸ’°ðŸš€ Day 28 of My JavaScript Journey: Crunching Numbers with a Loan Calculator!

Today, I navigated the world of finance by creating a Loan Calculator. Here's what I accomplished:

ðŸ”¢ Loan Calculation Logic: I implemented the core logic for calculating loan details, including monthly payments and total interest.

ðŸ”„ Dynamic Updates: I ensured real-time updates, allowing users to see the impact of different inputs on their loan terms.

Join me as I continue to unravel the complexities of financial calculations through code!
